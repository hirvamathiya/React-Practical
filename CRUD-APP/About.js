      <b>Quick Start : </b><br/>
    To get started with React Router in a web app, you’ll need a React web app. If you need to create one, we recommend you try Create React App. It’s a popular tool that works really well with React Router.First, install create-react-app and make a new project with it.

<b>Installation: </b><br/>
You can install React Router from the public npm registry with either npm or yarn. Since we’re building a web app, we’ll use react-router-dom in this guide.npm install react-router-dom
Next, copy/paste either of the following examples into src/App.js.
